# BookHaven
BookHaven is a web application for managing books and members of a library. It is written using PHP, MySQL, and the jQuery library.

The application is divided into five main parts:

* Dashboard: This is the main page of the application. It shows the number of books, members, and issued books.
* Books: This page shows a table of all the books in the library. It also allows the user to add, edit, or delete a book.
* Members: This page shows a table of all the members of the library. It also allows the user to add, edit, or delete a member.
* Issue: This page shows a table of all the issued books. It also allows the user to issue a book to a member.
* Return: This page shows a table of all the returned books. It also allows the user to return a book.

The application uses a MySQL database to store the data. The database is accessed using the PHP MySQLi extension.

The application also uses the jQuery library to add some interactivity to the application. The library is used to create a drop-down menu, to create a dialog box for adding or editing a book or a member, and to create a confirmation dialog box for deleting a book or a member.

The application is written in a modular way, with each part of the application in a separate file. This makes it easier to maintain and update the application.

The application is also fully responsive, which means it can be used on any device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop, a tablet, or a smartphone.

The application is also secure, as it uses prepared statements to insert data into the database. This prevents SQL injection attacks.

The application is also highly scalable. The application can be used by a small library or a large library. The application can also be used by a library with multiple branches.
